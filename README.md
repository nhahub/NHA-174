#### **1. Project Title**

**Analyzing the Correlation Between Depression Indicators and Suicide Rates
Using Data Integration and Statistical Modeling**

#### **2. Team Objective**

To investigate how depression levels (as indicated by survey or clinical data)
relate to suicide rates across different demographics, regions, and time periods
by combining and analyzing two separate data sets.

#### **3. Data Sources**

-   **Dataset 1:** Depression data

-   **Dataset 2:** Suicide data

Both datasets were cleaned, normalized, and merged based on shared attributes
such as **country**, **year**, and **age group**.

#### **4. Methodology**

1.  **Data Cleaning and Preparation**

    -   Removed missing or inconsistent entries.

    -   Standardized country and year formats.

    -   Handled null values using interpolation or median imputation or by
        removal.

    -   Normalized scales where needed (e.g., per 100k population).

2.  **Data Integration**

    -   Merged both datasets on key variables (e.g., country-year pair).

    -   Verified alignment using cross-checks and descriptive summaries.

3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

    -   Visualized distributions of depression prevalence and suicide rates.

    -   Identified trends over time and across regions.

    -   Checked correlation patterns using scatter plots and heatmaps.

4.  **Statistical and Analytical Modeling**

    -   Calculated **Pearson correlation coefficient** to quantify the
        relationship.

    -   Used **linear regression** to model how depression rates predict suicide
        rates.

    -   Explored **multivariate regression** to include other factors

5.  **Data Visualization**

    -   Created dashboards or charts showing:

        -   Suicide rate vs. depression rate trends.

        -   Geographic comparisons (maps).

        -   Age and gender-based patterns.

6.  **Findings and Insights**

    -   Found positive correlation between depression levels and suicide rates.

    -   Noted stronger correlations in specific regions or demographics.

    -   Discussed limitations (e.g., underreporting, cultural factors).

7.  **Conclusion**

    -   Summarized the statistical link between depression and suicide.

    -   Highlighted potential areas for policy focus or further mental health
        research.

8.  **Tools and Technologies Used**

    -   **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** for data analysis.

    -   **Tableau** for visualization.

    -   **Jupyter Notebook **for collaboration.
